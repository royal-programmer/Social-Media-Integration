## 🧑‍🏫 Lessons Learned

Gained knowledge of how to create an *android application* in **Android Studio** 
using **kotlin** and design using **.xml**. This was my Internship Project for 
**The Sparks Foundation** and this made me complete the project within a fixed
 time bracet and build my **Confidence**. I took reference from many resource 
 and figured my own way *to build codes*.
